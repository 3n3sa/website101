            <p>Scientists' research has revealed that viruses are by far the most abundant life forms on Earth. There are a
        million times more viruses on the planet than stars in the universe. Viruses also harbor the majority of genetic
        diversity on Earth. Scientists are finding evidence of viruses as a planetary force, influencing the global
        climate and geochemical cycles. They have also profoundly shaped the evolution of their hosts. The human genome,
        for example, contains 100,000 segments of virus DNA.</p>
